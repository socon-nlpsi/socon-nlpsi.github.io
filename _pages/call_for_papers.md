The **First Workshop on Integrating NLP and Psychology to Study Social Interactions (NLPSI)** will be co-located with the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM’25) and will take place in person on **Monday 23 June 2025**.

**Deadline for paper submission:** March 21, 2025


## Background and Scope

Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled not only the modeling of syntax and semantics but also the analysis of higher-level aspects of human communication—such as pragmatics, social dynamics, and emotional expression. Building on these advances, we can now address foundational questions that remain relatively unexplored in NLP: What are the core psychological processes that shape human behavior and communication? What factors influence how individuals perceive, process, and produce language, and how do these processes impact communication? Psychology has been studying human behavior, perception, and communication for years, offering valuable insights into these questions. At the same time, NLP allows us to move beyond controlled, small-scale experiments and conduct large-scale studies to better explore key theories and research questions in psychology.

NLPSI seeks to bridge these two disciplines with a primary focus on NLP research grounded in psychological theories. This interdisciplinary workshop invites researchers from NLP, Social Psychology, Communication Sciences, Affective Computing, and related fields to submit their work. We welcome submissions on topics including, but not limited to, the following:

- **Psychological constructs:** (e.g., beliefs, motives, feelings, affect, personality).
- **Psychological studies:** especially those focused on interaction.
- **Language and social identities:** including ethnicity and group affiliation.
- **Communication patterns:** such as empathy, persuasion, and conflict resolution.
- **Role of emotions in interpersonal communication:** including phenomena like emotion contagion and interpersonal emotion regulation.
- **LLMs in experimental, interactional studies.**
- **Cross-cultural variations in communication and behavior.**


## Submission Types

We invite the following types of submissions:

- **Long papers** (5 to 8 pages) that present original research, from preliminary findings to established contributions, including theory, experiments, or applications.
- **Short papers** (up to 4 pages) that introduce emerging ideas, work in progress, or early-stage research with clear significance.
- **Extended Abstracts** (up to 2 pages) that present ongoing work, position papers, previously published work, or research projects. Abstracts can be submitted either for inclusion in the proceedings (archival) or as non-archival contributions.
