  Workshop on<br>
  <span style="color:#4A90E2;">Social Context (SoCon) and Integrating NLP and Psychology to Study Social Interactions (NLPSI)</span><br>
  <span style="font-size:26px; color:#888;">SoCon-NLPSI @ LREC 2026</span>
</h2>


__SoCon__ and __NLPSI__ will be co-located with the **15th conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’26)**, held in Palau de Congressos de Palma, Palma de Mallorca (Spain), on 11-16 May 2026.

__Deadline for paper submission:__ February 16th, 2026


### Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone a significant evolution, opening up the possibility of capturing high-level aspects of human communication. Key areas of interest include the pragmatics, social dynamics, and the integration of social context, to further explore communicative intent. The SoCon and NLPSI workshops share a common interest in the social dimension of communication, although they address distinct challenges.
 
The __Social Context Workshop__ focuses on exploring the mechanisms through which context shapes language use to accurately model it. The workshop takes an interdisciplinary approach, seeking to establish a shared vocabulary on this topic and to explore how NLP can be integrated with Pragmatics, Sociolinguistics, and Sociology. By promoting alternatives to traditional crowdsourcing techniques, it aims to provide a platform for advancing community-centred approaches in NLP.

The __NLPSI Workshop__ examines the core psychological processes that shape human behavior and communication, as well as the factors that influence how individuals perceive, process, and produce language, and the impact of these processes on communication. This interdisciplinary workshop welcomes researchers from NLP, Social Psychology, and Affective Computing, intending to conduct large-scale studies that explore key theories and research questions across these domains.

Driven by the shared interest in human communicative behaviors and interactive dynamics, we announce a joint Call for Papers, organized into two specialized tracks: SoCon and NLPSI. To ensure the most appropriate review and placement, authors should direct their work to the track that best aligns with the core focus of their research contributions.
