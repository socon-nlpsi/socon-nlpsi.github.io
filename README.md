# SoCon-NLPSI Workshop @LREC

Repository for website: [https://socon-nlpsi.github.io](https://socon-nlpsi.github.io)  

## Editing  

The website is built automatically when you push or update the pages directly in GitHub. Always make edits in the `main` branch. The `gh-pages` branch is automatically generated and deployed.  

- To create a new page (e.g., Accepted Papers), create a `.md` file in the `_pages` folder.  
- To publish news updates or announcements, create a `.md` file as `_news/announcement_<n>.md`. Only the three latest news items will be displayed.
